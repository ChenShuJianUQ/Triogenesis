# Triogenesis

> Can we know the fundamental physical constants without experimental measurements?  
> Now, we can â€” using Triogenesis.

**Triogenesis** is a closed-form, recursive framework that generates fundamental physical laws, mass structure, and observer phenomena from a single generative principle.

It reproduces:

- The protonâ€“electron mass ratio  
- Electrostaticâ€“gravitational strength difference  
- The total mass of the observable universe  
- And more â€” all from first principles

This repository supports the collaborative expansion of Triogenesis into various domains of physics, cosmology, quantum theory, information science, consciousness studies and beyond.

## ðŸš€ Get Involved

We're building a collaborative map of how Triogenesis relates to existing physical theories, phenomena, systems, tools, and applications. You can contribute by:

- Suggesting mappings to known phenomena  
- Building simulations or tools  
- Refining predictions or edge cases  
- Connecting the framework to your own domain

## ðŸ“– Background

Triogenesis proposes that all emergent structure arises from a single recursive interaction rule â€” the generation of two directional uncertainties from one certainty. This produces a geometric buildup of quantized constraints ("straints") forming closed structures such as:

- The 12-straint relativistic frame  
- The 15-straint mass frame  
- The 173-layer recurrence limit
